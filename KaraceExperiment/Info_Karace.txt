There are a couple more steps to follow to reach the final eyedata_verbfinal.csv (dit is dus het bestand wat ik statistisch kan analyseren). Attached you will find 3 more scripts:
1.	"1_processing_and_merging_tobiipro" works with the individual output files we get after running 0_0_preprocessing_tobiipro. It merges all individual output files and processes them further and gives us "tobiipro_dataset_verbfinal.csv". I follow the same two-step procedure for the output files from T-120 eye-tracker with a different script as the screen dimensions were different. In the end I have two different datasets: one from tobiipro and the other is from T120. 
2.	"merging_T120_tobiipro" merges these two datasets and gives us "all_adult_data_verbfinal.csv". 
3.	"verb_final_analyses" gives us the final dataset that we shared in osf (eyedata_verbfinal.csv). The purpose of this script is to reduce the number of columns that we share in osf since the final dataset is very large, and we wanted to share only the columns relevant for the analyses we did.
Ook deel ik twee Excel bestanden met timing informatie van de segmenten in de zinnen die we hebben gebruikt in de Karaca et al. studie. Timing is heel belangrijk in eye-tracking studies, omdat je op de ms nauwkeurig wil aangeven wat er gebeurt over de tijd (waar mensen naar kijken op het scherm). Hieronder nog wat extra informatie hierover:

Yes, the onset of the second NP was indeed different for each trial. The exp_verbfinal and exp_verbmedial files contain the second NP onset (in ms) information for each trial. We decided to center the durations based on second NP onset (meaning the second NP onset was the new 0) and the duration/onset/offset of the first NP, adverb etc regions was calculated based on averages across trials. But the end of the predictive time window was always the onset of the second NP (i.e. always 0) for each trial, we thought that was the most important part as we did not want to have any second NP information included in the predictive time window.
